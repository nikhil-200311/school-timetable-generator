Can you give list of things that are done like this, dont mention any code 
A. For generating timetable
1.First we will calculate the total no of classes which are required to maintain a proper timetable for the complete class. 
2. Now we will track rema periods needed for each class and subject
3. After this we will check for teachers availability if the teacher can tech the student during an hour and make an teacher schedule
4. (i)Now we check if the teacher is available in the time slot from the teacher's schedule, if the teacher is present then we will return false
  (ii) Now we check if teacher can teach subject if no we return false
  (iii) Now we check if the class needs this subject, if the subjects class has alnready been done then we will return false
5. If all the above condition satisfies i will return true that we can assign a teacher

6.Now to assign a period for the class we check with the days of the weekly
(i) now we check if all days schedule are fixed for the base condition we will get ack all the periods. 
(ii) if the above condition does not fullfills then we take the current days
(iii) now if the periods in that days is less than the no of periods that are required then  we assign period of (day + 1)
(iv) we will try to schedule each class for this period of the day
